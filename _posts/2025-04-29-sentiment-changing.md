All market trading sideways today, bitcoin continues to show strong resiliance. Maybe the tariff headlines is running fatigue and we are basically looking at financial condition easing from here on.

Macro data wise, I would pay close attention to the China PMI tomorrow tomorrow, as it could be the 1st sign that shows the whole tariff thing is taking a negative hit on Chinese economy. In which case, we'd be looking at China starts its easying cycle soon enough.
